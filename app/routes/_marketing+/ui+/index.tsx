				Goal
			</Heading>
			<Text size="lg" className="mt-4">
				The andrecasal/ui library aims to be a high-quality library that allows you to create complex UIs very fast. This means it needs to be easy to understand, easy to use, and
				needs a clear separation of concerns between design and functionality.
			</Text>
			<Text size="lg" className="mt-4">
				When you're focused on coding the UI, you don't care about how it looks, but you need to know you'll have complete control over it in the future. Likewise, when you're
				focused on design, you don't want to be bothered with code and functionality.
			</Text>
			<Text size="lg" className="mt-4">
				This clear separation of concerns is achieved by colocating all of the design variables in the tailwind.css file. If you're a designer, all you need is to change those values
				to achieve the design results you're looking for. If you're a developer, you can focus on the code and functionality without having to worry about the design at all, knowing
				the designer has complete control over it.
			</Text>
			<Text size="lg" className="mt-4">
				To understand how this works, take a look at the{' '}

				section.
			</Text>
			<Heading as="h2" size="3xl" className="mt-14">
				NPM package
			</Heading>
			<Text size="lg" className="mt-4">
				The goal is to make the components so good that you seldom need to change them. When we reach that stage, I'll make this a proper NPM package for the sake of installation
				speed as well.
