				The Theme Panel is a drop in component that allows you to preview the theme configuration in real time. This is probably the last component I'll build.

				Custom utility-based TailwindCSS classes

				These CSS variables drive custom, prefixed, utility-based TailwindCSS classes. This has a few benefits:

				Components use the custom classes
			</Heading>
			<Text size="md" className="mt-2">
				Because the components use these custom classes, they become theme controlled. Additionally, you still have the full power of (non-CSS-variable controlled) TailwindCSS
				classes at your disposal for inside the components or other parts of your app.
