But after I started being tutored by André, I took a liking to what I was learning because I started to understand it, and it even became fun. For once, I actually felt confident! André is really nice and patient: he would draw diagrams and break them down for me, use other programming languages to help me see the connection between them and assembly, and everything was great! I had never had a teacher like this. When the exam result came back, I was baffled when I saw that I had went from failing this class two years in a row, to having a 16/20 as my grade. André's teaching method and dedication is, in my opinion, unbeatable.",

They assumed we went looking for the missing pieces. I tried researching on the internet and talking to friends, but I couldn't find good resources on the internet and my friends were just as lost as I was. When I started the tutoring lessons with André, my grades increased exponentially. I've been with André for one year at this point, the current class is the second one we're doing together. In the first class, if I know anything about Arduino, it was because André taught me. I mean it! Not only did André taught me how to complete the Arduino projects, he taught me to the point where I could complete the exams on my own. And in terms of availability, André is top.",

						Ok, so you're in college and you don't want to be disrespected, shamed, or humiliated by your peers. Much less by your teachers. Having gone through college and been
						a tutor for more than 16 years, I know how you feel. You feel like your teachers don't care enough, your colleagues are just as lost as you, and going to the library
						won't magically make your grades go up. Besides, spending more time reading the recommended books won't help because you can't lose any more time and you're already
						sleeping less than what would be healthy.

							You might have even tried tutoring centers. I remember having gone to this tutoring center for Calculus when I was in high school. I packed my backpack, left home
							one hour before, arrived at the center, and started studying. We would pay 30€/hour for a teacher in a room full of students. During the two hours I was there, I
							was able to ask exactly two questions to the teacher, whose answers were short and too hurried to understand anything useful. I get it, the teacher wanted to
							spread her time across all the students. I remember asking myself "is it worth it to lose two hours to come and go, pay 30€/hour to come study here, and just get
							the teacher's attention twice in two hours? For this, I might as well study at home!"
						</Text>
						<Text className="mt-8">
							After that, I tried a private math tutor. He knew the subject matter, but couldn't bridge my knowledge to his knowledge. He couldn't understand which background
							knowledge I was missing to understand the current concepts, so he mechanistically repeated the same answers that I wouldn't be able to understand until he gave me
							the background knowledge required. It was frustrating.

							Are you looking for a better solution to improve your grades, and feel proud of yourself and the things you'll be able to accomplish? That's why I'm here. To help

							Imagine this: your teacher asks you a question that he knows no student would be able to answer. But you have a secret weapon - tutoring lessons with an expert
							tutor with excellent communication skills. As you start to thoroughly and beautifully answer your teacher's question, your colleagues start to look at you in awe
							and you see a smile of approval begin to form on your teacher's lips. When you're done there's a pause while the shock of your answer subsides. You feel a rush of
							adrenaline as the awareness that everyone is now looking at you hits you. You chuckle and your teacher says “Guys, make friends with him, he's going places!”

							During the rest of the class, all your colleagues will be thinking you'd be a good friend to have. Trust me, you won't have any problems making friends. Your

						<Text className="mt-8">
							You're doing the exams. Confident. Focused. Your colleagues struggle to remember the concepts they need to answer the questions. You completely blaze through the
							memorization questions the teacher posed, knowing every single answer by heart. A great start makes you feel even more confident and allows you more time to
							answer all the questions and revise your answers after you're done. Still, 10 minutes left on the clock. You turn in your exam early, feeling proud of yourself
							and everything you're achieving! You leave the exam room, take your phone out and dial your parent's phone number.

							remember you have a trusted tutor always by your side! You take your phone, open WhatsApp, and write a quick message. A minute later you receive a clear

							The average rate of passing grades of my more than 600 students is 98,75%. I dedicate myself to my students and I'm relentless when it comes to making sure
